## Project Summary
This is an interactive game that encourages users to utilize and grow their argumentative writing skills. 

###  Project Description
This project will be an educational game that focuses on enhancing argumentative writing skills among high school students. The emphasis is on creating an engaging and educational experience that resonates with high school students and improves their argumentative writing abilities. To accomplish this, our team will create a game with a similar structure to JackBox Games. Students will join into a multiplayer game where the teacher is the host and through minigames students will submit their own open-ended answers and vote on the best of them. These minigames will provide students different settings and opportunities to construct logical, coherent, and persuasive arguments. The idea is that the answers that are the most persuasive will win. This encourages students to take their audience into account as well as remaining factual and logical. 

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Once the game is built people should be able to download the application and play it without needing anything else. 

Currently the game is not built, so to change the code or view progress Unity will need to be installed to run the installation. Unity Hub is also a useful thing to instal to better manage projects.

We are using Unity LTS Release2022.3.17f1: https://unity.com/releases/editor/qa/lts-releases



### Add-ons
Make sure git is installed on your computer:

* Windows: $ git update-git-for-windows
* Linux: $ sudo dnf install git-all   or   $ sudo apt install git-all
* macOS: $ git --version

Hackbox: [https://github.com/ashbash1987/hackbox-unity/wiki/](https://github.com/ashbash1987/hackbox-unity)

Once the project is open in Unity 

* Open your Unity project up, then go to the Package Manager (_Window_ â†’ _Package Manager_).
* Click the _+_ button in the top-left and then _Add package from git URL..._.
* In the prompt, enter `https://github.com/ashbash1987/hackbox-unity.git` and click _Add_.
* You should then see Hackbox.ca listed as a package in your project.


### Installation Steps
* Install Unity and Unity Hub.
* Download this code from GitHub.
* In Unity Hub click the down arrow next to the _Add_ button.
* Click _Add project from disk_ and select the file with the downloaded code from this GitHub.
* The unfinished game should open in Unity.

## Functionality
At the top of Unity there is a play button. Pressing this button allows a preview of how the game will look and play. ANY EDITS YOU MAKE TO THE CODE WHILE IN THIS MODE WILL NOT BE SAVED. 

Currently when the play button is pressed a room code will appear on the title screen along with the player count. By going to `hackbox.ca` you can enter the room code and join the game. The player count will go up and your name will briefly appear on screen. 

On the bottom pannel in Unity there should be two tabs: `Project` and `Consol`. By clicking on `Consol` while previewing the game you should see messages to the consol about the room code and "Members" connecting to the room code. 

Currently none of the "Games" have been developed, so their buttons only move when you hover over them.
